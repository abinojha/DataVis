### Graffiti Complaints in New York City: An Overview of 311 Data
#### Background
#####  Simply, Graffiti is an art that is painted on the wall or in any other public places. Graffiti it is colorful and beautiful, on the other, it is a mess that makes town or city untidy and worst maintained. Graffiti is more common in urban where more people and huge buildings are concentrated than the rural areas. Graffiti artist may believe it enriches the beauty of city, but it makes city ugly for the city administration. However, city dwellers may have inconsistent perceptions on Graffiti. They may respond either. So, graffiti today has become an issue of debate, is it a culture or crime? However, in New York City, there are some many cases of complaints on Graffiti. Based on the 311 data, this project aspires to make some visualizations. 

#### Research Questions
#####  The general question of this project is to overview, How the people of New York City has complaints on Graffiti? The specific questions of this projects are as follow; i.    How are the Graffiti complaints made in 5 boroughs? ii.    Which agency received the most Graffiti complaints? iii. How the complaints were filed agency wise in all five Boroughs?iv.    Which month of the year has the least Graffiti complaints?v. How the complaints were dispersed in five Boroughs? 

#### Audience of the Project
##### As mentioned earlier, is graffiti culture or crime? may be a debatable issue from the cultural perspective but from 'rule of law' standpoint itâ€™s a crime. New York City Graffiti Law clearly advocates, "No person shall write, paint, or draw any inscription, figure or mark of any type on any public or private building or other structure or any other real or personal property owned, operated or maintained by a public benefit corporation, the city of New York or any agency or instrumentality thereof or by any person, firm, or corporation, or any personal property maintained on a city street or other city-owned property pursuant to a franchise, concession or revocable consent granted by the city, unless the express permission of the owner or operator of the property has been obtained" . Therefore, understanding and hearing the graffiti complaints is important to New York Police Department (NYPD) and Department of Sanitation New York (DSNY). Understanding the most graffiti-prone areas, mostly used public properties and the most complaints months and so forth, the concerned authorities could take necessary action to discourage and control the graffiti arts. This visualization could be helpful to lunch alternative programs to discourage graffiti arts to maintain city's beauty. On the other side, artists and other who loves to research and read the graffiti could be benefited by this visualization. They could get substantial information about the graffiti-prone areas, which type of public property gets more graffiti so that they could go and enjoy the graffiti.

#### Sources of Data
##### The source of data is NYC Open Data. The graffiti complaints made in all five boroughs, organized form 2011 to present are fetched from '311 Service Request from 2011 to Present' data sources. Data is available at; (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/dataset/311-Service-Requests-From-2011/fpz8-jqf4). Graffiti, Agency name, Boroughs, Locations, Public Properties (Commercial, Residential and Public Spaces) and Incident Areas are some variables used in the visualization.

#### Sketches to Visualize the Data
