## Gross Domestic Product of China, India, Russia, and the United States: The Data Visualizations From 1997 to 2016
##### Abin Ojha
### Introduction
The China, India, Russia, and the United States are the most powerful countries of the present world. These four countries are more powerful and stronger than other countries in terms of land, population, economy, technology, and innovations. The term 'powerful countries' is used here following the reports of the [World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/03/worlds-biggest-economies-in-2017/), [The American Interest](https://www.the-american-interest.com/2017/01/24/the-eight-great-powers-of-2017/), and the writings of [Mead and Keeley](https://www.hudson.org/research/13270-the-eight-great-powers-of-2017), and more. Which is the most powerful among the four might be an issue of debate and study, but it is unanimous that these are the most powerful countries in the contemporary world. After studying these articles, I aspired to make a comparative study of the Gross Domestic Product and associated variables of these four countries over the past two decades. This visualization reviews the GDP and associated variables of China, India, Russia, and the United States from 1997 to 2016.

'GDP measures the value of goods and services produced in a given period. It measures production output in terms of market prices'. Generally, GDP is measured using the following formula; GDP= Consumption + Investment + Government Spending + Exports â€“ Imports (Fioramonti,2013) .

GDP is the monetary value of goods and services produced in a nation during a given time, usually one year. GDP growth rate is an important statistical measure adopted by economists to evaluate, 'How fast is the economy growing'? For example, if the annual GDP growth rate is 3 percent, that means the economy is 3 percent larger than it was in the previous year (Brezina, 2014:4). "GDP per capita (PPP based) is gross domestic product converted to international dollars using purchasing power parity rates and divided by total population". As such It is a measure of a country's wealth. It is a measure of if the average person in country A is richer than in country B. This is assessed through GDP Per Capita and Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) (PPP is a neoclassical economic theory that states that the exchange rate between two countries is equal to the ratio of the currencies' respective purchasing power. also allows for the comparisons among countries with wide income disparities).

Simply, an increase in the volume of GDP and associated indicators indicates the economic growth and development of a nation. Being based on this simple and general theory, this work visualizes the GDP (Current US $), GDP Growth (Annual %), and GDP Per Capita Purchasing Power Parity (Current International $) of China, India, Russia, and the United States in the last two decades. Statistical data is collected from the World Bank database. Details of the data are presented in the Sources section below.

### Rationale of the Selection of a Topic
China, India, Russia, and the United States are the most powerful countries in the world. Because of this, the study of population, economy, technology, and military/ security of these countries are the interesting topics in and of themselves. In this project, I seek to study and visualize some aspects of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of these four countries over the last two decades.

It is expected that the visualization of some aspects of GDP would sketch the entire economic situation of these selected countries, other things remaining the same. This visualization includes: GDP (current US $), GDP Growth Rate (annual %) and GDP Per Capita PPP (international $).  These three aspects of GDP are selected assuming that the visualization of GDP (the current US $) displays the economic situation, GDP growth rate indicates the direction of the economy and GDP Per Capita presents the average income of the entire population.

### Research Questions
This visualization aspires to make a comparative study on GDP of four powerful countries. The specific questions of this visualization are as follows: *Which country achieved the highest average GDP (Current US $) over the last two decades?* *How has the GDP growth rate (Annual %) of these four countries changed?* *What was each year's GDP Per Capita?*

### Audience of the Study
The audience of this visualization is all who are interested in studying economic indicators such as students of economics and politics, and other intered in geopolitics. This visualization gives sketches as well as statistical values of Gross Domestic Product of China, India, Russia, and the United States of last two decades. 

### Sources of Data
The World Bank provided the data for this visualization. The variables section consists of database, countries, series, and time. From a list of 264 countries, the top four countries were selected. Then, from the series; GDP (current US $), GDP Growth (Annual %) and GDP Per Capita PPP (Current International $) were chosen as per the objectives of the visualization and from time (availability year range 1960-2017), and the years 1997 to 2017 were selected to make a study of last two decades. Then, from the download option, the Excel spreadsheet for the sorted data was downloaded. The data used in this visualization is available at this; [Link](http://databank.worldbank.org/data/reports.aspx?source=world-development-indicators)

### Visualizations of Data
The following visualizations are made based on the fetched data:

### Discussions and Findings

#### [A] Which country achieved the highest average GDP (Current US $) over the last two decades?
The GDP values of all four countries from 1997-2016 were presented separately in bar diagrams to make visualization simple and clearly readable. Then each bar diagram was presented as the area graphs to visualize the trend of GDP over the years. This area graphs help tje audience to see how the GDP of these countries are increasing/decreasing over the last two decades. An average line is drawn in each area graphs to give the average GDP over the last two decades. This is helpful to make a quick comparison of average GDP among or between these four countries. The United States has the highest GDP than other three countries. The data shows that the GDP of the United States, China, and India are increasing every year, but Russia has decreasing GDP after 2013. The data shows that the GDP of China is increasing, and the GDP of India is, too. The GDP of the United States is ascending but the GDP of Russia is descending in the recent years. 

#### [B] How has the GDP growth rate (Annual %) of these four countries changed?
To visualize the GDP Growth (Annual %), I used a simple bar diagram for each country and then presented the data in a line graph to make a comparative study. It is amazing to note that the China and India have far higher GDP annual growth rates than the United States and Russia. Among these four countries, GDP Growth (annual %) of the United States is far below that if China and India in the last two decades. This visualization found that the GDP growth rate of China and India is far higher than that of  Russia and the United States.

#### [C] What was each year's GDP Per Capita?
The GDP per Capita Purchasing Power Parity (current International $) of the selected four countries are visualized in the Composite Bar Chart. This diagram consists of bars which are sub-divided into two or more parts, and the length of the bar is proportional to the totals. The composite bar chart was chosen to visualize the GDP per capita because the sub-divisions of a bar could be a good option to present the data of all four countries in a single bar. This visualization is further presented in scatter plots that gives a clearer view of how the GDP per capita has changed over the year since 1997. The GDP per capita of the United States is higher than the other three countries.

### Conclusions
The project visualized the GDP of the four countries using Tableau public. It studied, the GDP of the four countries from 1997 to 2016. The visualizations showed that the GDP (current US $) of the United States is greater than other three countries. It means that the United States has the largest economy among the four countries. Surprisingly, the GDP growth rate (annual %) of the United States is slower than that of China and India, and Russia's GDP growth rate in the recent years is negative. This indicates that the economy of the United States and Russia is contracting whereas the economy of China and India is growing each year. GDP Per Capita, PPP of all four countries is increasing every year. Conversely, the GDP Per Capita of the United States is greater than other three countries. It indicates that the average person in the United States is richer than the average person in India, Russia, and China.
